<div className="tldr-box">
  <h3>TL;DR</h3>
  <p>Get a free .me domain through GitHub Education → Create a repository → Deploy with GitHub Actions → Connect your domain. Total time: ~30 minutes (plus DNS propagation).</p>
</div>

## What You'll Need

- GitHub account and university email (.edu)
- Basic Git knowledge
- Your website code (HTML/CSS or React/Next.js/Vue)

## Step 1: Get Your Free .me Domain (5 min)

1. Apply for [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (approval takes 1-3 days)
2. Once approved, claim the **Namecheap .me domain** offer from your benefits page
3. Register your `.me` domain with the education discount code (makes it free for year 1)

**Note:** The GitHub Student Pack specifically offers a free `.me` domain for one year through Namecheap.

**Tip:** Use `yourname.me` for a personal, memorable domain that stands out!

## Step 2: Create Your Repository (2 min)

Create a new repo named `yourusername.github.io` at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

- Can be **public or private** (GitHub Pro via Student Pack allows private repos!)
- Repository name must match your GitHub username exactly
- Alternative: Use any repo name for a project site at `yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

## Step 3: Deploy Your Site

<div className="deployment-tabs">
  <h3>Choose Your Deployment Method:</h3>

### Example GitHub Actions Workflows

<details>
  <summary>Show example workflow (React/Vite)</summary>

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Show example workflow (Next.js)</summary>

First, add this to your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Then create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

## Step 4: Connect Your Custom .me Domain (10 min)

<div className="warning-box">
  <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Do steps 4.1 and 4.2 in order to prevent security issues!
</div>

### 4.1: Add Domain to GitHub First

1. Go to repo **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Custom domain", enter your domain (e.g., `yourname.me`)
3. Click **Save**

### 4.2: Configure DNS in Namecheap

1. Log into [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login/) → Domain List → Manage → **Advanced DNS**
2. Delete existing A/CNAME records
3. Add these records ([official Namecheap guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/)):

| Type | Host | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A Record | @ | 185.199.108.153 |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.109.153 |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.110.153 |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.111.153 |
| CNAME | www | yourusername.github.io. |

**Note:** Make sure to include the trailing dot (`.`) after `github.io` in the CNAME record!

### 4.3: Enable HTTPS

Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation ([check status](https://dnschecker.org/)), then:

1. Return to repo **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Check **Enforce HTTPS**

✅ Done! Visit `https://yourname.me` to see your site live.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>Domain not working yet?</strong></summary>

DNS propagation (the process of your domain settings spreading across the internet) takes time. Think of it like mailing a change-of-address form—it doesn't update everywhere instantly.

**Timeline:**
- Minimum: 15-30 minutes
- Typical: 1-2 hours
- Maximum: Up to 24 hours (rare)

**How to check:**
1. Visit [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/)
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourname.me`)
3. Look for green checkmarks showing your GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.108-111.153)

**Still not working after 24 hours?**
- Double-check your DNS records in Namecheap match exactly (including the trailing dot in CNAME)
- Make sure you saved the custom domain in GitHub Settings → Pages
- Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is a CNAME file and why does it matter?</strong></summary>

**What is it?**
A CNAME file is a simple text file that tells GitHub Pages which custom domain your site should use. It literally just contains your domain name (e.g., `yourname.me`) with no other formatting.

**How it traditionally works:**
- When you first set up GitHub Pages by committing files directly (the "Deploy from branch" method), you'd manually create a file named `CNAME` (no extension) in your repository root
- This file would contain just your domain name: `yourname.me`

**How it works with GitHub Actions (modern approach):**
When you add your custom domain in **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**, GitHub automatically:
1. Creates the CNAME file for you
2. Commits it to your `gh-pages` branch (the deployment branch Actions uses)
3. Updates it whenever you change your domain in settings

**Why it might disappear:**
If you're using the old "Deploy from branch" method with your `main` branch and manually adding a CNAME file, GitHub Actions workflows can overwrite it because they generate a fresh deployment. This is why we recommend:
- Always set your custom domain in **Settings → Pages** (not by manually creating the file)
- Use GitHub Actions deployment (which handles the CNAME automatically)
- Never manually create a CNAME file when using Actions—let GitHub manage it

**Bottom line:** As long as you've added your domain in the GitHub Pages settings, the CNAME file is handled automatically. You don't need to touch it!

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>GitHub Actions workflow failing?</strong></summary>

Check the **Actions** tab in your repository for detailed error logs. Click on the failed workflow run to see what went wrong.

**Common fixes:**

**Wrong build output path:**
Your workflow needs to know where your build files are created.
- Vite/React: Usually `dist`
- Next.js (with export): `out`
- Create React App: `build`
- Vue: `dist`

Check your `package.json` scripts and update the workflow's `path:` accordingly.

**Missing dependencies:**
Make sure all your packages are in `package.json`. If you installed something with `npm install` but didn't save it (old npm versions), it won't be in the file.

**Node version mismatch:**
If your site works locally but fails in Actions, try matching the Node version:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Change to match your local version
```

**Missing workflow permissions:**
Make sure your workflow file includes:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

**Environment configuration:**
Some frameworks need environment variables. Add them to your workflow:
```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Getting 404 errors when you refresh or navigate directly to a page?</strong></summary>

**Why this happens:**
Single-page applications (SPAs) like React, Vue, or Angular use "client-side routing"—they handle URLs in JavaScript, not on the server. When you refresh on `/about`, GitHub Pages looks for an actual `/about/index.html` file, doesn't find it, and shows a 404.

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Hash-based routing (easiest)**
Use URLs like `yoursite.com/#/about` instead of `yoursite.com/about`:

*React Router:*
```javascript
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
// Use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter
```

*Vue Router:*
```javascript
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes,
})
```

**Option 2: 404 redirect trick**
Create a `404.html` file that redirects to `index.html`. This works but can cause issues with actual 404s.

**Option 3: Use a framework with built-in support**
Next.js, Astro, and other meta-frameworks handle this better with static export configurations.

**Note:** Hash routing is the most reliable solution for SPAs on GitHub Pages since it doesn't require server configuration.

<details>
  <summary><strong>My site looks broken or unstyled!</strong></summary>

**Base path issues:**
When your site is at `yourname.github.io/projectname` (project site, not user site), your assets load from the wrong path.

**Fixes by framework:**

*Vite (React/Vue):*
```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/repo-name/', // Add this if using project site
})
```

*Next.js:*
```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  basePath: '/repo-name', // Add if using project site
  output: 'export',
}
```

*Create React App:*
Add to `package.json`:
```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name"
```

**Custom domain users:** If using a custom domain (like `yourname.me`), you don't need base path configuration!

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Changes aren't showing up on my live site?</strong></summary>

**Check these in order:**

1. **Did your workflow run?** Go to the Actions tab—if it failed, fix the error first
2. **Browser cache:** Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Try incognito mode** to rule out caching completely
4. **Check the deployment time:** Workflows take 1-3 minutes to complete
5. **Correct branch:** Make sure you're pushing to the branch that triggers your workflow (usually `main`)

**Pro tip:** Add `?v=1` (then `?v=2`, etc.) to your URL to bypass cache during testing: `yourname.me?v=1`

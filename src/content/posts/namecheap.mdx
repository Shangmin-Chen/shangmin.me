A year ago I was exploring [Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), 
a collection of experiences for students to develop software skills. Github Education Pack has numerous offers from partners that provides products for free.
One of the offers come from Namecheap, the offer is an one year domain name registration on the .me TLD.

**Note:** As of Jan 3, 2026 github education pack has expanded to include name.com and .tech partnerships as well.

## What You'll Get

A professional website at `yourname.me` with free hosting, automatic deployments, and HTTPS. Total cost: $0 for the first year.

## Before You Start

You'll need:
- GitHub account + university email (.edu)
- Git and Node.js installed ([Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- Your website code ready

**Quick check:** Run `git --version` and `node --version` in your terminal.

## Step 1: Get Your Free Domain (5 min)

1. Apply for [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (1-3 day approval)
2. Once approved, claim the **Namecheap .me domain** offer
3. Register your domain (e.g., `yourname.me`) - free for year 1

## Step 2: Create Repository (2 min)

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it `yourusername.github.io` (use your exact GitHub username)
3. Make it public or private (both work)
4. Click **Create repository**

**Important:** The repository must be named exactly `yourusername.github.io` - this avoids complicated base path configurations.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Site

Choose based on your project type:

### For React, Next.js, or Vue (GitHub Actions)

**Why?** Builds your site automatically on every push.

1. In your repo, go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. In your project, create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

4. Copy the workflow below for your framework
5. Commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

6. Check the **Actions** tab - wait for the green checkmark (2-3 min)

Your site is now live at `https://yourusername.github.io`!

    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Next.js Workflow</strong></summary>

Update `next.config.js`:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: { unoptimized: true },
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

Create workflow:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vue Workflow</strong></summary>

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:

      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

For Vue Router, use hash mode to avoid 404s:
```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes: [/* your routes */]
})
```

</details>

### For Plain HTML/CSS Sites

**Why?** No build step needed - just upload files.

1. Push your files:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add website files"
git push origin main
```

2. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**
4. Select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
5. Click **Save**

Your site goes live in ~2 minutes at `https://yourusername.github.io`!

## Step 4: Connect Your Domain (10 min)

### 4.1: Add Domain to GitHub

1. Go to repo **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `yourname.me`
3. Click **Save** (you'll see a DNS error - that's expected)

### 4.2: Configure DNS in Namecheap

1. Log into [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) → **Domain List** → **Manage**
2. Go to **Advanced DNS** tab
3. Delete all existing A/CNAME records
4. Add these records:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A Record | @ | 185.199.108.153 | Automatic |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.109.153 | Automatic |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.110.153 | Automatic |
| A Record | @ | 185.199.111.153 | Automatic |
| CNAME Record | www | yourusername.github.io. | Automatic |

**Important:** Include the period (`.`) after `github.io` in the CNAME record.

### 4.3: Wait for DNS (15 min - 2 hours)

DNS changes take time to propagate. Check progress at [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/) - look for the GitHub IPs (185.199.108-111.153).

### 4.4: Enable HTTPS

Once DNS propagates:
1. Return to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Check **Enforce HTTPS**

Done! Visit `https://yourname.me` 🎉

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Workflow Failed?</strong></summary>

Check the **Actions** tab in your repository for error details. Common fixes:

**Wrong output folder:**
Update the `path:` in your workflow file:
- React/Vue/Vite: `dist`
- Next.js: `out`
- Create React App: `build`

**Missing packages:**
Run `npm install` to add missing dependencies to `package.json`.

**Node version mismatch:**
Change the Node version in your workflow to match your local version:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Change to match: node --version
```

**Permission errors:**
Ensure your workflow includes:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Changes Not Showing?</strong></summary>

Try these steps in order:

1. **Check deployment status:** Go to the **Actions** tab - look for a green checkmark
2. **Hard refresh your browser:** 
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. **Try incognito/private mode** to rule out caching
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the deployment to complete
5. **Verify you pushed to main:** Run `git status` to confirm

**Pro tip:** Add `?v=1` to your URL to force reload: `yourname.me?v=1`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Domain Not Working After 24 Hours?</strong></summary>

**Checklist:**
- [ ] DNS records in Namecheap match exactly (including the trailing `.` in CNAME)
- [ ] Custom domain is saved in GitHub **Settings** → **Pages**
- [ ] Check [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/) - you should see the GitHub IPs (185.199.108-111.153)
- [ ] Try visiting both `yourname.me` and `www.yourname.me`
- [ ] Clear browser cache or try a different browser/device

**Still not working?**
Check [GitHub's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

<details>
<summary><strong>Getting 404 on Page Refresh (React/Vue)?</strong></summary>

**Why this happens:**
Single-page apps handle routing with JavaScript. When you refresh on `/about`, GitHub Pages looks for an actual file and shows a 404.

**Solution: Use hash routing**

This changes URLs from `yoursite.com/about` to `yoursite.com/#/about`:

**React Router:**
```javascript
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <HashRouter>
      {/* your routes */}
    </HashRouter>
  );
}
```

**Vue Router:**
```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes: [/* your routes */]
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CSS or Images Not Loading?</strong></summary>

Make sure your asset paths are relative, not absolute:

**HTML:**
```html
<!-- ✓ Good -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
<img src="./images/photo.jpg">

<!-- ✗ Avoid -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css">
<img src="/images/photo.jpg">
```

**React/Vue:**
```javascript
// ✓ Good
import './App.css'
import logo from './assets/logo.png'

// ✗ Avoid
import '/App.css'
```

**Check the browser console (F12)** for 404 errors to see which files aren't loading.

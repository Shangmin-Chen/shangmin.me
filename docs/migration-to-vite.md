# Migration to Vite

The reason for the migration is for the adoption for MDX support.

## Data
- Static content is now stored in js data files
- Rendered in the frontend through data files
## Blogs
- Stored in .mdx files within src/content/posts

## What's next
- In hindsight the data js files should move into the same content/posts directory, maybe content/data.
